# Cure-Care
Healthcare is a part of life we all consider to be something we are entitled to – it is our right to
have access to healthcare whenever we need it. However, for many people across the world, this is
simply not an option. The motivation behind our project is to apply the knowledge gained during
the time being and provide the solution in form of a website that is integrated with machine
learning models which gives users a convenient way for the confirmation of their hazardous
diseases.
In this project “Cure & Care” I have given a glimpse of various predictive tests which include
the Heart Disease Prediction Test, Liver Cancer Prediction Test, Kidney Cancer Prediction Test,
Diabetes Prediction Test. All the predictive analyses have been done using various classification
models
1) HEART DISEASE PREDICTION - This prediction test was trained using Logistic
Regression & Random Forest Classifier. Based on the accuracy score we observed that
Logistic Regression gave better results.
2) LIVER CANCER PREDICTION - This prediction test was trained using Logistic
Regression, Random Forest Classifier & Support Vector Machine. Based on the accuracy
score we observed that Random Forest Classifier gave better results.
3) KIDNEY CANCER PREDICTION - This prediction test was trained using the Deep
Learning technique (using Artificial Neural Network). The purpose behind using ANN was
to apply the knowledge gained during the course time & check the functioning of neural
networks.
4) DIABETES PREDICTION - This prediction test was trained using Decision Tree
Classifier, Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier. Based on the accuracy score
I observed that the Decision Tree Classifier gave better results.
I also tried to integrate our models to the website created using HTML 5 & CSS using Flask
framework in python & importing pickle module where I tried to render our models to different
web pages created.
